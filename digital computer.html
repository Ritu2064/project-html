       <p>Digital computers are machines that employ a binary number system which has two digits only: 0 and 1. Using this binary system, many complicated tasks are undertaken. It processes the data represented in discrete and the main three components of digital computers are as follows: Input. Processing.
        It is used to run everything from spacecraft to factories, healthcare systems to telecommunications, banks to household budgets. Since its invention during World War II, the electronic digital computer has become essential to the economies of the developed world.<br><br>
        Atanasoff invented the first electronic digital computer in the 1930s at Iowa State College (now known as Iowa State University).
        It was generally believed that the first electronic digital computers were the Colossus, built in England in 1943, and the ENIAC, built in the United States in 1945.<br><br></p>
        

       
        <ol>The features of digital computers are as follows:
            <li>speed</li>
            <li>They are automic.</li>
            <li>They produce accurate result of accurate instructions.</li>
            <li>They are versalite as they can perform several task at the same time.</li>
            <li>They are dilligence as they never get tired of feel boredom.
            </li><br><br>
