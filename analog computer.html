       <p>The computer which provides us continuous information is called analog computer.An analog computer is a computer which is used to process analog data. Analog computers store data in a continuous form of physical quantities and perform calculations with the help of measures. It is quite different from the digital computer, which makes use of symbolic numbers to represent results.<br><br>
       
        <ol>The features of analog computers are as follows:
            <li input type="circle">It is designed for specific task.</li>
            <li input type="circle">It has limited memory space.</li>
            <li input type="circle">The accuracy of this computer is poor.</li>
            <li input type="circle">No complex processing thats why result is available instantly.</li>
            <li input type="circle">It operated by measuring physical quantities such as voltage, temperature, pressure, speed, etc.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ol>Some of the examples of analog computer are as given below:
            <li input type="i">Thermometer</li>
            <li input type="i">Seismometer</li>
            <li input type="i">Voltmeter</li>
            <li input type="i">analogue clock</li>
            <li input type="i">speedometer</li>
            </ol>
